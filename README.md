# pQueue

THIS SCRIPT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! It works in its current state (1/13/21), it is however not user friendly at all. The code is commented (although lacking and not finished), but as of now you need coding experience to configure it properly for use in your own server. Future updates will drastically improve the user friendliness and a detailed configure guide will also be added in the next few days.

This is a FiveM server queue with discord based priority built on [SpaceTheDev](https://github.com/SpaceTheDev/)'s Discord API.
You **NEED** [sPerms](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-sperms-real-time-discord-perms/1686063) and [sDiscord](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-sdiscord/168002) for this resource to work.
